## Description

This project, developed as part of "The Odin Project" JavaScript course, is a simple web-based implementation of the classic tic-tac-toe game. It allows two players to take turns placing their markers ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Responsive and intuitive user interface.
- Dynamic updating of game status and player turns.
- Comprehensive error handling to prevent invalid moves.
- Option to restart the game at any time.
- Clear indication of game outcomes, including wins and draws.


## How to Use

1. Players take turns clicking on the empty squares of the grid to place their markers.
2. The first player to align three of their markers horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
3. If all squares are filled without any player achieving a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.
4. Click the "Restart Game" button to start a new game at any time.

## Future Enhancements

One potential future enhancement for this project is to implement an AI mode, allowing players to play against the computer. This would involve integrating AI logic using algorithms such as minimax or alpha-beta pruning to provide a challenging single-player experience.
